# Weather-Data-App-ASP.NET-MVC-Entity-Framework
This is an application that gives Chicago weather forecasts and allows you to look up daily weather going back to 1926. 
I have included a link to this project in my profile. The home page includes links that lead you to holiday data going back
to 1926. I created a role for myself so that I am the only one that has access to the functionality of adding, editing, or deleting records.
